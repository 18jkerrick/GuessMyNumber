This game is very simple. To play, enter a number between 1 and 20 into the guessing box. If the number is higher than the one that the computer randomly 
generated, then it will tell you too high. If the number is lower than the one that the computer randomly generated, then it will tell you too low. Based 
on the computers response, you should adjust your guess to accurately guess the number. The game is won when the number the computer generated number is 
the same as your guess. The highscore is then saved. To play again, just press the "Again!" button in the upper right hand corner. 

I used HTML and CSS for the frontend and Javascript for the backend logic.

To play, download the files into a directory and open the index.html in a browser of your choice.
